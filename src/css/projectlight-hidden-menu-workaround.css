/* This fixes an issue with the Project Light top nav menu being hidden in dev
   mode. It is hidden in the Project Light CSS and shown by JavaScript.

   However, with non-extracted CSS, the stylesheet link is inserted just before
   the project light JS executes. However, the styles don't get applied until
   after the call stack has cleared. As a result, jQuery.show() call does
   nothing, leaving the elements hidden. The PL css is then applied, hiding the
   menu.

   This overrides the PL FOUC CSS to always show the top nav. Note that the
   selectors need to be higher priority than the PL selectors, hense the html
   prefix. This is because webpack doesn't define/guarantee loading order of
   CSS files require()d via js.
