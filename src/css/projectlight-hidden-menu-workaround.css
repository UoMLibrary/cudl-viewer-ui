/* This fixes an issue with the Project Light top nav menu.
   It is hidden in the Project Light CSS and shown by JavaScript.
   However, with non-extracted CSS, the hiding styles don't seem to apply
   before the jQuery.show() call is made, so it does nothing. After the show()
   call the CSS is applied which hides the top nav.

   This overrides the PL CSS to always show the top nav. */
